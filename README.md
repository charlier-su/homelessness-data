# Homelessness Data

In this project, we will use data science to investigate homelessness in the US.

## Data Source

The data from this project are from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development. The data set `05b_analysis_file_update.csv` and the data dictionary `HUD TO3 - 05b Analysis File - Data - Dictionary.csv` will be used for the investigation. Details about this data are available in the HUD's report [Market Predictors of Homelessness](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/sites/default/files/pdf/Market-Predictors-of-Homelessness.pdf) in the section titled DATA.
